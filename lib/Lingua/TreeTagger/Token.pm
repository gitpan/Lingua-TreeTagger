=head1 NAME

Lingua::TreeTagger::Token - Representing a token tagged by TreeTagger.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Lingua::TreeTagger::Token version 0.01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::TreeTagger;

    # Create a Tagger object.
    my $tagger = Lingua::TreeTagger->new(
        'language' => 'english',
    );

    # Tag some text and get a new TaggedText object.
    my $tagged_text = $tagger->tag_file( 'path/to/some/file.txt' );

    # A TaggedText object is essentially a sequence of Lingua::TreeTagger::Token
    # objects.
    foreach my $token ( @{ $tagged_text->sequence() } ) {

        # A token may contain a single SGML tag...
        if ( $token->is_SGML_tag() ) {
            print 'An SGML tag: ', $token->tag, "\n";
        }

        # ... or a part-of-speech tag.
        else {
            print 'A part-of-speech tag: ', $token->tag, "\n";
            
            # In the latter case, the token may also have attributes specifying
            # the original string...
            if ( defined $token->original() ) {
                print '  token: ', $token->original(), "\n";
            }

            # ... or the corresponding lemma.
            if ( defined $token->lemma() ) {
                print '  lemma: ', $token->lemma(), "\n";
            }
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is part of the Lingua::TreeTagger distribution. It defines a class
for representing a unit in the output of TreeTagger in an object-oriented way.
Such a unit consists in either (i) exactly one part-of-speech tag and possibly
a token and a lemma (tab-delimited) or (ii) an SGML tag. See also
L<Lingua::TreeTagger> and L<Lingua::TreeTagger:TaggedText>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new()>

Creates a new Token object. This is normally called by a
Lingua::TreeTagger::TaggedText object rather than directly by the user. It
requires two parameters:

=over 4

=item C<tag>

A string containing either a part-of-speech tag or an SGML tag.

=item C<is_SGML_tag>

1 if the value of the C<tag> attribute is to be interpreted as an SGML tag,
0 otherwise.

=back

If the <is_SGML_tag> attribute is set to 0, the constructor may take two
additional optional parameters:

=over 4

=item C<original>

A string containing the original token to which the part-of-speech tag has been
attributed.

=item C<lemma>

A string containing the lemma of the original token.

=back

=back

=head1 ACCESSORS

=over 4

=item C<tag()>

Read-only accessor for the 'tag' attribute of a token (either a TreeTagger
part-of-speech tag or an SGML tag).

=item C<is_SGML_tag()>

Read-only accessor for the 'is_SGML_tag' attribute of a token (value is C<1> if
the tag is an SGML tag and C<0> otherwise).

=item C<original()>

Read-only accessor for the 'original' attribute of a token, i.e. the original
word token to which a given part-of-speech tag was assigned. Available only if
the value of 'is_SGML_tag' is C<0>.

=item C<lemma()>

Read-only accessor for the 'lemma' attribute of a token, i.e. the base form of
the original word token to which a given part-of-speech tag was assigned.
Available only if the value of 'is_SGML_tag' is C<0>.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item An SGML tag cannot have a 'original' attribute

This exception is raised by the class constructor when a new Token object is
simultaneously specified as being an SGML tag and having a 'original'
attribute.

=item An SGML tag cannot have a 'lemma' attribute

This exception is raised by the class constructor when a new Token object is
simultaneously specified as being an SGML tag and having a 'lemma'
attribute.

=back
